# 🧠 LLM Club

> **Explore, Fine-Tune, and Deploy Open-Source Language Models with Hands-On Practical Implementations**

## 🚀 About

**LLM Club** is a community-driven open-source initiative to help learners and developers **understand, fine-tune, and experiment with Large & Small Language Models (LLMs & SLMs)** using practical, real-world examples.

We dive deep into **model architectures, fine-tuning techniques, evaluation strategies, and deployment workflows** — all demonstrated through easy-to-follow notebooks and projects.
